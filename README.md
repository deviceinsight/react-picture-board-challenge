# React Picture Board Challenge

Hi there. We have this neat picture board here that is almost finished.
The only thing that is missing is a way to load more pictures while scrolling.

The challenge is to extend this mini app with a mechanism to load more pictures when you scroll close to the bottom of the page.
You need to use your power to implement this feature with **React**.
You can install everything you want, extend this app with new components, libraries, frameworks, rewrite the entire app if you want.

Feel free to surprise us if you want with adding features or changing the styling into something you prefer for example!

## However

The criteria for completing the challenge is just:

- When you scroll close to the bottom, additional pictures have to be loaded automatically
- Shuffling the pictures is still possible
- Moving back to the top of the page is still possible

You can use `yarn start` to start the app (it's a CRA).
